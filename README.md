The objectives of this project are:

𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐳𝐞 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚: Utilize SQL to extract insights such as monthly revenue trends, top-selling products, and customer purchasing behavior.

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Employ Pandas for cleaning, exploring, and preparing the dataset for in-depth analysis.

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to present key insights through clear and engaging visualizations.

𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥 & 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Use GitHub for version control, collaboration, and comprehensive documentation of the entire workflow.

 Key Steps & Workflow
 
1. SQL Analysis (SQLite)
   
Objective: Store and query structured data for foundational analysis.

Tasks Performed:

Created a relational database and imported datasets into normalized tables.

Executed key SQL queries:

Monthly sales revenue.

Revenue contribution by customer segments.

Top regions by sales.

Exported SQL query results as CSV files for further analysis.

2. Data Cleaning & Exploration (Pandas)
   
Objective: Prepare and enrich data for analysis.

Steps Taken:

Handled missing values and removed duplicates.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and customer behavior.

Engineered new features such as:

Revenue per product

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

3. Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
   
Objective: Visualize key insights from the data.

Visuals Created:

📈 Line Chart – Monthly sales revenue trends.
